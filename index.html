        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>HTTP</span><br>
                The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML.
            </li>
            <li><span>Improved Accessibility</span><br>
                One of the advantages of HTML5 is that it has improved the accessibility of websites. In HTML5 screen readers can easily access content and understand various tags such as &ltheader>, &ltfooter>, &ltnav>, &ltsection>, &ltaside> without a glitch. This not only improves the display but also eases the process of coding. This new improvement offers improved access to the users irrespective of the screen size, orientation and resolution of the device.            </li>
            <li><span>Doctype</span><br>
                Did the codes and tags in the previous version give you much hassle? Don’t worry!  It’s plain and simple Doctype &lt!DOCTYPE html> in the new version and you don’t need to copy and paste the long and unreadable code as you have been using all the time. Apart from being simple it also works with all the legacy versions of major browsers including IE6.
            </li>
            <li><span>Cleaner Code</span><br>
                “Keep the codes clean”, this is what every coding tutorial would tell you and now you can keep the codes clean with HTML5. This has been one of the major improvements in this new version of markup language as it allows you to write descriptive and semantic code cleanly. You also be able to separate style from the content without any special effort.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Separation of content from presentation</span><br>
                CSS facilitates the publication of content in multiple presentation formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile device), the geographic location of the user, and many other variables. 
            </li>
            <li><span>Site-wide consistency</span><br>
                When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and "cascading", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. 
            </li>
            <li><span>Bandwidth</span><br>
                A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to others. This is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each occurrence of the element. 
            </li>
            <li><span>Accessibility</span><br>
                Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users.
